# Google Foobar

This repo contains the 10 Google Foobar Challanges I encountered during my two play throughs. My Solutions are written in python or java depending what language was better suited for said problem.
I have not encluded solutions in this repo but if you need help or are stuck message me and I might be able to give you some tips.
