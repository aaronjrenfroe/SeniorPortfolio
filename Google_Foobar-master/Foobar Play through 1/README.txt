Notes and Solution Constraints

Level 1->2 were pretty straight forward

Level 3->5 are the good ones that you've got to really think about and possibly do some learning

You are Given: 
48  hours for Level 1
72  hours for level 2
96  hours for Level 3
336 hours for Level 4
504 hours for Level 5

You are given a choice to submit your solution in java or python. 
I used both depending on which language was simpler for the problem

Solution Constraints:

Java
====

Your code will be compiled using standard Java 7. It must implement the answer() method in the solution stub.

Execution time is limited. Some classes are restricted (e.g. java.lang.ClassLoader). You will see a notice if you use a restricted class when you verify your solution.

Third-party libraries, input/output operations, spawning threads or processes and changes to the execution environment are not allowed.

Python
======

Your code will run inside a Python 2.7.6 sandbox.

Standard libraries are supported except for bz2, crypt, fcntl, mmap, pwd, pyexpat, select, signal, termios, thread, time, unicodedata, zipimport, zlib.
